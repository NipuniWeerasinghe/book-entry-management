The development models are the various processes or methodologies that are being selected for the development of the project depending on the projectâ€™s aims and goals. There are many development life cycle models that have been developed in order to achieve different required objectives. The models specify the various stages of the process and the order in which they are carried out.

  <br/>
The selection of model has very high impact on the testing that is carried out. It will define the what, where and when of our planned testing, influence regression testing and largely determines which test techniques to use.

Evolutionary development model is based on the idea of rapidly developing an initial software implementation from very abstract specifications and modifying this according to your appraisal. Each program version inherits the best features from earlier versions. Each version is refined based upon feedback from yourself to produce a system which satisfies your needs. At this point the system may be delivered or it may be re-implemented using a more structured approach to enhance robustness and maintainability. Specification, development and validation activities are concurrent with strong feedback between each. This is the only method appropriate for situations where a detailed system specification is unavailable. Effective in rapidly producing small systems, software with short life spans, and developing sub-components of larger systems. It is difficult to measure progress and produce documentation reflecting every version of the system as it evolves. This paradigm usually results in badly structured programs due to continual code modification. Production of good quality software using this method requires highly skilled and motivated programmers. Here the objective of the process is to work with you to explore their requirements and deliver a final system. The development starts with the better understood components of the system. The software evolves by adding new features as they are proposed.

The purpose of any analysis activity in the software life cycle is to create a model of the system's functional requirements that is independent of implementation constraints. The primary tasks in object-oriented analysis (OOA) are finding the objects, organizing the objects, describing how the objects interact, defining the behavior of the objects, defining the internals of the objects. Common models used in OOA are use cases and object models. Use cases describe scenarios for standard domain functions that the system must accomplish.
Object-oriented design (OOD) constraints could include the hardware and software platforms, the performance requirements, persistent storage and transaction, usability of the system, and limitations imposed by budgets and time.
